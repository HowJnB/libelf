This is the public release of libelf-0.6.4, a free ELF object
file access library. If you have problems with applications
that use libelf and work with the commercial (SVR4, Solaris)
version but not with this one, please contact me.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have libelf-0.5.2 installed, you probably
have a file .../include/elf.h that contains the single line
``#include <libelf/elf.h>''. REMOVE THIS FILE BEFORE YOU RUN
configure.

Installation is straightforward - the package is autoconf'ed.
Just do ``cd libelf-<version>; ./configure; make; make install''.
Header files will be installed in .../include/libelf/.  If your
system does not provide its own version of libelf.h or nlist.h,
you may want to run ``make install-compat'' to install them. I
recommend that you use ``-I.../include/libelf'' instead.

You need an ANSI C compiler to build libelf. Gcc is optimal.

On some systems you can build and install a shared libelf
library. To do this, pass ``--enable-shared'' to configure.
Another configure option, ``--enable-debug'', adds debugging
code to libelf; if you don't run into problems, you will
probably not need it.

NLS is available and enabled by default (although there are
no message catalogs included in the distribution (yet)). To
turn it off, pass the ``--disable-nls'' option to configure.

Libelf can use gettext or catgets for accessing message
catalogs.  If gettext is available AND is part of libc (i.e. not
in a separate library), it will be used. Otherwise, configure
will look for catgets.  If you have gettext in a separate
library and want to use it, you should pass the library's name
to configure, e.g. ``LIBS=-lintl ./configure''. Note that you
MUST link your libelf-based applications with -lintl then,
which is probably not what you want.

If you have GNU gettext installed on your system, and if GNU
gettext runs on top of the catgets interface (Linux systems),
configure will refuse to use it and use catgets instead. If
you absolutely want to use GNU gettext, go ahead and rebuild
it (which is IMHO a good idea in general in this case):

	cd .../gettext-0.10
	ac_cv_func_catgets=no ac_cv_func_gettext=no ./configure
	make
	make install

After that, return to the libelf build directory, remove
config.cache, and start over.

Missing things:

	* There is no documentation.
	* The COFF file format is not understood.
	* nlist(3) is incomplete; the n_type and n_sclass
	  members of struct nl are set to zero even if type
	  information is available.
	* Libelf does not support 64bit ELF files (yet).

Changes since 0.5.2:

	* some bug fixes
	* mmap support
	* new directory layout
	* There is a new function, elf_delscn(), that deletes
	  a section from an ELF file. It also adjusts the
	  sh_link and sh_info members in the section header
	  table, if (and ONLY if) the ELF standard indicates
	  that these values are section indices. References
	  to the deleted section will be cleared, so be careful.
	* my email address has changed ;)
